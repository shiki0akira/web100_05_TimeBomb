    {
      q: 'Does everyone need a phone?',
      a: 'No. The whole game runs on one phone — that phone is the bomb and it goes round the circle. This is unlike the other games in the series, where everyone joins a room by scanning a QR code.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I see how long is left?',
      a: 'No, not for a second. That is deliberate: if you could see a countdown, nobody would take the phone in the last ten seconds and the game would stall. How fast it ticks does not tell you how close it is either.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I skip a task I cannot do?',
      a: 'Yes, just tap done. There is no score and nobody is counting who skipped what.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can we add our own tasks?',
      a: 'Yes. Use “Add your own” on the setup screen and file it under a category — it will still be there next time. They stay on this device and are never uploaded.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Passing a phone around hand to hand feels a bit much.',
      a: 'Put it in a zip bag, or use an old spare phone as the bomb.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if the screen locks mid-round?',
      a: 'The game keeps the screen awake while it runs. If it does get pushed to the background, the moment you come back it recalculates — and if the fuse ran out while you were away, you land straight on the explosion.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to the loser?',
      a: 'That is up to you — the app does not decide. Everyone in the room saw who was holding it; what happens next is your call.',
